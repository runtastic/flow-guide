# 01 - React

In this tutorial, we will discuss some React related topics and find out, how
`flow` can help us write more proactive, terse code.

It will start out with some component implementations and will
highlight `flow`s features along the lines. So just read the files from top to
bottom and you should get a good idea how things work.

Later on, more complex examples will be introduced, especially in some more
biased contexts like `redux`, `redux-saga` or `recompose`.

**Disclaimer**: You will probably need some React knowledge to fully understand our
covered use-cases :-)
